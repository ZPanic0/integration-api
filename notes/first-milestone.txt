First milestone:
look at hubspot, sendgrid, zapier, mailchimp apis
how to get test account
what kind of auth is required
are there existing node modules (donâ€™t use but check)
what api calls will I use
how will I register callbacks
what data fields will come from/go to apis (what am I receiving/sending)
write out mapping of data fields
workflow in terms of api calls
make up use cases
ex. create a contact in mail chimp and add to a list
sendgrid: send email to this email
zapier: trigger an action or workflow
