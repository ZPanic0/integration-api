Used for sending bulk emails to a list of users.

Lists are now called Audiences

- Audiences
-- Limited to 1 per free account
-- Seems to be Mailchimp's top level organization of users
-- Mailchimp recommends not using multiple audiences

- Categories and Groups
-- Categories are containers for Groups
-- Users can be part of multiple Groups
-- Users can be added by the account holder or through a signup
-- Zapier used as an example of integrating with Groups

- Segments
-- An automatically managed collection based on predefined criteria
-- Modular snap in logic based on properties of Subscriber (user)

- Tags
-- Lower function than Segments or Groups as users cannot implicitly or explicitly join them
-- Seems to be exclusively for organization
-- Also seems to be unlimited in count
-- CAN filter by tags
